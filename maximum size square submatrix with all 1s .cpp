1) Construct a sum matrix S[R][C] for the given M[R][C].
     a)    Copy first row and first columns as it is from M[][] to S[][]
     b)    For other entries, use following expressions to construct S[][]
         If M[i][j] is 1 then
            S[i][j] = min(S[i][j-1], S[i-1][j], S[i-1][j-1]) + 1
         Else /*If M[i][j] is 0*/
            S[i][j] = 0
2) Find the maximum entry in S[R][C]
3) Using the value and coordinates of maximum entry in S[i], print 
   sub-matrix of M[][]
